    <h2>Chef John's Chocolate Decadence</h2>
    <p>This dessert is pure decadence. The flourless chocolate decadence cake was all the rage in the 1980s. <br> As I vaguely remember, the decade celebrated decadent overindulgence, and this dessert is that—and more. <br> By modern standards, this cake is ridiculously rich. In fact, some of you may find it too intense, but most true chocolate lovers will be in heaven. <br> Serve with ice-cold fresh raspberry sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.125 pounds semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 <br>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan.</li>
        <li>Step 2 <br> Melt semisweet chocolate and unsalted butter together in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring
        frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula, until chocolate and butter are completely melted and
        combined. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Step 3 <br> Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl with a whisk or electric mixer until pale and very thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Sift
        in flour, cayenne, and salt; whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Step 4 <br> Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture; stir to combine. Pour chocolate mixture into remaining egg
        mixture and stir until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Step 5 <br> Bake in the preheated oven until just barely set, with a jiggle below the surface, 14 to 15 minutes. Cool to room
        temperature, about 30 minutes. Wrap in aluminum foil and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
